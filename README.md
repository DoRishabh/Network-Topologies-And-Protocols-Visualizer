Explanation of protocol Visualizations:
1. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):
Nodes: Routers (R1, R2, R3, R4).
Edges: BGP peering between routers (e.g., R1 ↔ R2, R2 ↔ R3).
ASes: The routers are grouped into Autonomous Systems (AS 100, AS 200), representing a typical BGP setup.
2. OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):
Nodes: Routers (X, Y, Z).
Edges: OSPF links between routers, where each link represents a direct communication path in an OSPF network.
3. MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching):
Nodes: Label Edge Routers (LER1, LER2, LER3).
Edges: MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), showing the label-based forwarding paths between routers.
4. IPsec (Internet Protocol Security):
Nodes: Routers (Router1, Router2, Router3).
Edges: IPsec tunnels between routers, indicating secure encrypted communication channels.
5. 5G NR (New Radio):
Nodes: gNodeBs (base stations), UEs (user equipment).
Edges: Links between base stations and user equipment, representing wireless communication.
Interactivity:
Zooming: Users can zoom in and out using mouse gestures.
Drag Nodes: Users can drag the nodes around the visualization.
Dynamic Layouts: Different layouts like circle or grid are used depending on the protocol.
Customization:
You can further customize the node styles (colors, shapes, etc.) based on each protocol’s attributes.
Add more specific details (e.g., BGP AS path attributes, OSPF link costs) for richer visualizations.
